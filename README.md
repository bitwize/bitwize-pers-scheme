bitwize-pers-scheme
===================

Just some personal utility libraries I wrote in R7RS Scheme. Tested in
Chibi.

* **(bitwize functional)**: Some utilities for functional programming.

* **(bitwize parser)**: A parser library.

Thanks go to Thien-Thi Nguyen for the "<name>-pers-scheme" idea
(originally intended for Guile libraries).
